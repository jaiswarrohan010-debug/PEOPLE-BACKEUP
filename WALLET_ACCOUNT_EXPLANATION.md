# üí∞ Wallet Amount Location & Account Structure

## üéØ **Where is the Wallet Amount Actually Stored?**

### **1. Database Storage (Primary Location)**
The wallet amount is stored in **your MongoDB database** in the `wallets` collection:

```javascript
// Wallet Model (models/Wallet.js)
{
  userId: ObjectId,        // Freelancer's user ID
  balance: Number,         // Current wallet balance (e.g., 2000)
  isActive: Boolean,       // Wallet status
  createdAt: Date,         // Wallet creation date
  updatedAt: Date          // Last balance update
}
```

**Example Wallet Record:**
```json
{
  "_id": "64f1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1",
  "userId": "64f1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j2",
  "balance": 2000,
  "isActive": true,
  "createdAt": "2025-09-07T10:30:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-09-07T12:45:00.000Z"
}
```

### **2. Virtual Wallet System (Not Real Bank Account)**
**Important**: The wallet amount is **NOT** in your app's current account. It's a **virtual wallet system** that tracks balances within your platform.

## üè¶ **How the Money Flow Works**

### **Step 1: Client Payment**
```
Client pays ‚Çπ2000 via PhonePe ‚Üí Money goes to PhonePe's account
```

### **Step 2: Platform Processing**
```
PhonePe processes payment ‚Üí Sends callback to your app
Your app updates freelancer's virtual wallet balance ‚Üí +‚Çπ2000
```

### **Step 3: Commission Deduction**
```
Platform commission (10%) ‚Üí ‚Çπ200 goes to platform wallet
Freelancer receives ‚Üí ‚Çπ1800 in their virtual wallet
```

### **Step 4: Withdrawal Process**
```
Freelancer requests withdrawal ‚Üí Admin approves
Admin transfers money from YOUR bank account ‚Üí Freelancer's bank account
```
