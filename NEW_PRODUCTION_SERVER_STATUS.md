## 🔧 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Issue Identified**
The new Render deployment is not including the latest OTP service updates with the test numbers. This could be due to:

1. **Deployment Still in Progress**: Render deployments can take 5-10 minutes
2. **Build Cache Issues**: Render might be using cached build
3. **Environment Variables**: Missing environment variables in new Render account
4. **Git Sync Issues**: Repository might not be fully synced

### **Files That Should Be Deployed**
- ✅ `utils/otpService.js` - Updated with test numbers
- ✅ `models/Job.js` - Fixed validation issues
- ✅ `models/CommissionLedger.js` - Fixed ObjectId usage
- ✅ `routes/freelancer.js` - Added test endpoints and commission logic
- ✅ `routes/client.js` - Added test endpoints and cash payment
- ✅ `admin-cli.js` - Updated with withdrawal management
- ✅ `config/paymentGateway.js` - Updated callback URLs
