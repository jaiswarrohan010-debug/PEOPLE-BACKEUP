## 🔧 Required Deployment Steps

### **Step 1: Update Production Server**
The production server at `https://freelancer-backend-jv21.onrender.com` needs to be updated with the latest code that includes:

1. **Updated OTP Service** with test numbers
2. **Fixed Job Model** (paymentStatus and paymentMethod validation)

4. **Cash Payment System** with commission tracking
5. **Commission Ledger System** with threshold enforcement
6. **Test Endpoints** for profile creation
7. **Updated Admin CLI** with withdrawal management

### **Step 2: Deployment Methods**

#### **Option A: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)**
If the repository is connected to Render with auto-deploy:
1. Push latest code to GitHub repository
2. Render will automatically deploy the updates
3. Wait for deployment to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)

#### **Option B: Manual Deployment**
1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Find the `freelancer-backend-jv21` service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
4. Wait for deployment to complete

### **Step 3: Verify Deployment**
After deployment, test the production server:

```bash
# Test health check
curl https://freelancer-backend-jv21.onrender.com/api/health

# Test authentication with new test numbers
curl -X POST https://freelancer-backend-jv21.onrender.com/api/auth/send-otp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone": "+919898989898"}'
```
